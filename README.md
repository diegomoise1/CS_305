## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

- Artemis Financial, a consulting company specializing in individualized financial plans, was the client. They were seeking to modernize their operations and specifically required assistance in securing client data and financial information.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
- I performed an extensive vulnerability assessment, identifying weak points, and applied the latest encryption technologies and techniques. Coding securely is essential to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and ensure the integrity of the system. Software security adds significant value to a company by protecting its reputation, maintaining customer trust, and ensuring legal compliance, all of which directly impact the company's overall wellbeing.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
- The challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was identifying hidden or complex flaws that could potentially be exploited. Simultaneously, this process was helpful as it allowed me to recognize areas where I could strengthen the security mechanisms and reduce the risk of future breaches.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
- I increased layers of security by implementing robust encryption, adding verification through checksums, and complying with software security testing protocols. In the future, I would employ a combination of automated vulnerability scanning tools, manual code reviews, and ethical hacking to assess vulnerabilities and decide on appropriate mitigation techniques.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
- To ensure both functionality and security, I conducted rigorous testing through the automated OWASP testing and followed best practices in secure coding. After refactoring, I retested the application, using both automated tools and manual reviews to ensure that no new vulnerabilities were introduced, and that all previously identified issues were adequately addressed.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
- I used a combination of encryption technologies, secure coding guidelines, vulnerability scanning tools, and security testing methodologies like penetration testing. Leveraging frameworks and libraries known for security and adhering to recognized industry standards will be practices I continue to carry into future projects.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
- From this assignment, I could present a detailed case study outlining the initial challenges, the methods used for vulnerability assessment, the mitigation strategies implemented, and the final successful outcome. Including code snippets, security test results, and client feedback would further demonstrate our expertise in secure software development and our commitment to delivering quality results.
